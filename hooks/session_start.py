"""Restore learning context when AGY (Antigravity) or Claude Code starts or resumes a session.

Antigravity sends a JSON event on stdin with workspacePaths / invocationNum.
Claude Code sends a JSON event on stdin with hook_event_name='SessionStart'.
For a project with active learning notes, we output instructions telling the agent
which files to read. Otherwise we exit silently. This hook does not teach, write
notes, or parse conversation transcripts. The events that trigger it (including
compaction) are configured in hooks.json.
